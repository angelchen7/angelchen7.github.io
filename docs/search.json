    "text": "Bees 🐝\nLarge, open-access biological datasets, like those hosted by Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI), have become increasingly accessible due to greater data collection, compilation, and storage. These databases serve to better inform our understanding of species occurrences, interactions, and ecosystem structure, broadly. In this work, we leverage GloBI data to better understand patterns of pollination, a biologically and economically essential biotic interaction between plants and pollinators. Specifically, we sought to develop a better understanding of bee specialization of pollen, an evolutionary trait in bees that underscores the stability and structure of pollinator interaction networks. We compared GloBI and expert-compiled data to better understand patterns in resource specialization. We then trained various machine learning models (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) to create a defining line between specialist and non-specialist bees. In addition, data transformation was also useful for more clearly differentiating our specialization groups.\nThrough our exploration of GloBI, we found several sources of bias, including the limitations of community data collection and scarcity of rare bees. We found a strong positive correlation between the number of sources (i.e. literature, natural history collection) citing the interactions of a bee species and the number of plant families visited by that same bee species. We also found that while expert classification of bee specialists visit fewer plant families than other bees in the GloBI dataset, there are clusters of species that diverge from the expected trend. Our trained models suggested that binary classification was not completely effective in determining the label of “specialist” or “non-specialist” for all bee species. These findings indicate that observer bias, on a global scale, can skew our definition of resource specialization or generalization. Moreover, large, open-access datasets like GloBI can change our previous understanding of biological interactions and systems by accessing novel data sources and aggregation.\nLinks: project report and ESA 2021 meeting poster"

    "text": "Renewable Energy ☀️\nRenewable energy consumption has been increasing in the United States over the past 20 years as people sought alternatives to fossil fuels. Sources of renewable energy include hydroelectric power, geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass. In this project, I investigate the total monthly consumption of renewable energy in the United States from January 2001 to January 2020 and try to figure out a model that can be used to forecast how much renewable energy will be used in the future.\nIn order to achieve this goal, I used the Box-Jenkins methodology. This method involves data transformation, differencing, examining autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions, model parameter estimation, checking for stationarity and invertibility, and diagnostic checking. To summarize my results, I came up with three plausible models for the data, but ended up with two satisfactory models that passed all checking. I concluded that one model was better than the other because it had lower AICc, an information criterion, and used it to predict renewable energy consumption for February 2019 to January 2020. My predictions followed the actual data values well, meaning that my model can be used for future forecasting, and it also supports the conclusion that renewable energy consumption is on an upward trend.\nLinks: project report and GitHub repo"

After much discussion with the group, we designed a workflow where we created a data key to connect the raw column names to the new, standardized column names. Then I worked on a script where I reshaped the raw files and joined them with the data key to automate the column name standardization process for 12 datasets with completely different structures. I also standardized all dates, species names, and filled in missing taxonomic information for each species. This workflow resulted in a harmonized/standardized CSV file containing marine consumer information for over 700 unique species.\nLinks: GitHub repo\n\n\nPlant Reproduction\nThe Plant Reproduction working group wanted plant trait data to research why some plants produce large amounts of seeds every few years. To assist this group, my team and I retrieved data from the TRY Plant Trait Database, which included traits such as plant seed mass, lifespan, flowering season, and seed persistence. Then we wrangled the TRY data so that we can combine it with a larger dataset of plant traits that the working group already had. After much wrangling, we refined the integrated master dataset to include 56 total variables for over 100 species. This dataset was then used for further downstream analyses.\nLinks: GitHub repo"

They split the reading assignments between their group members, but to speed the process along, they requested for me to find a way to quickly decide whether a paper is worth reading or not.\nSo I created a script that filters and ranks the abstracts and titles based on positive and negative keywords. The more positive keywords an abstract and its associated title have, the more likely it was for the group to include the full paper in their meta-analysis. On the other hand, if a paper’s abstract/title has more negative keywords, it means that the group will probably not be interested in this paper.\nAfter discussing with the group, we decided that it would be helpful for the group members to see how many negative keywords were in each paper’s abstract and title. So I added a column to each person’s reading assignment list that shows the count of negative keywords for each abstract and title. That way, they could prioritize reading the abstracts that have the least negative keywords and save time by discarding the ones that have the most negative keywords.\nIn the end, the group was able to use my work to decide on the 700 or so papers that will be included in round 2 of the meta-analysis.\nLinks: GitHub repo"

My name is Angel and my interest in data science, open science, and reproducible workflows started from my days as a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara! Feel free to meander on this website to explore some examples of my work.\nCurrently, I work as a data scientist at the Malone Disturbance Ecology Lab, focusing on scripting reproducible workflows to clean and analyze diverse data sources, as well as providing technical support to my lab members. I also develop web apps and R packages for the lab along the way!\nPreviously, I worked as a data analyst at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), supporting the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network synthesis working groups. I helped the working groups develop reproducible workflows to wrangle, harmonize, analyze, and visualize ecological datasets. I also hosted workshops for them.\nBefore joining the LTER, I was a data curator for NCEAS Arctic Data Center. I created metadata records using Ecological Metadata Language (EML) and archived ecological datasets from research projects focused in the Arctic. Ensuring that the metadata is complete is a crucial part of making the data finable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others in the future.\nIn my spare time, I like to look at and admire birds. My favorite birds include rock doves and mourning doves.

Then using that shapefile, I derived annual rasters showing the areas that were burned in a particular year. I prepared the metadata for these data products and published them on the Environmental Data Initiative Repository.\nNext, I created custom functions to perform some calculations. I calculated the total number of fires and the time since the last fire using the annual rasters. I also calculated statistics using the harmonized fire perimeter shapefile in order to get the annual total area burned, total wildfire area burned, total prescribed fire area burned, mean fire size, and area/perimeter. To allow others to easily explore this spatiotemporal information, I developed an interactive Shiny web app.\nFinally, my supervisor, Dr. Sparkle Malone, compiled a vegetation shapefile for the Everglades, calculated more summary statistics from my results, and designed visualizations for our publication. After I polished the visualizations, we were able to publish our findings in Scientific Data.\nLinks: GitHub repo, data products, Shiny web app, publication\n\n\nFlux Gradient\nThe Flux Gradient working group had an existing pipeline to download and analyze eddy covariance data for 8 NEON sites, however they requested me to rerun and expand their workflow to include an additional 39 more sites. After I downloaded the latest version of the data, I ran into errors, so I had to debug and edit the scripts accordingly, as there were some peculiarities with a few sites.\nMy debugging later led me to the discovery that the format of the data had changed, which was unsuitable for some parts of the workflow. I communicated this issue to the other members of the group in our meeting and they advised me to redownload a larger version of the dataset to get the necessary columns.\nDespite the small setback, I finished debugging and running the workflow for all 47 sites just in time for the working group’s in-person meeting. Since I did not have the domain knowledge, I had to explain to the group about the issues I ran into whenever I needed them to make a decision on the workflow for me. The teamwork enabled me to seamlessly process around 1 terabyte of data.\nAs our project evolved, our GitHub repository became bloated with everyone’s scripts so to ensure that our work was organized and reproducible, I standardized naming conventions for the main scripts and functions, fixed file paths, formatted scripts for publication, and revamped the README.\nLinks: GitHub repo"
