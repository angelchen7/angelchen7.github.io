I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics & Data Science! My interests are open science and reproducible workflows! 

Currently, I work as a data analyst at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)), supporting the Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) Network synthesis working groups. I help the [working groups](https://lternet.edu/current-working-groups/) develop reproducible workflows to wrangle, harmonize, analyze, and visualize ecological datasets. I also host [workshops](https://angelchen7.github.io/workshops.html) for them. 

Before joining the LTER, I was a data curator for NCEAS [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/). I created metadata records using Ecological Metadata Language (EML) and archived ecological datasets from research projects focused in the Arctic. Ensuring that the metadata is complete is a crucial part of making the data finable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others in the future. 

In my spare time, I like to look at and admire birds. My favorite birds include rock doves and mourning doves. Here are some pictures I've taken over the years:
